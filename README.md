# Vector Implementation in C

This project provides a basic implementation of a dynamic array, commonly known as a vector, in C++. It serves as a learning exercise for understanding how dynamic arrays work and how to implement them in C.

## Features

- **Dynamic Array:** Implements a dynamic array that can resize itself as elements are added.
- **Element Access:** Provides methods for accessing elements by index.
- **Capacity Management:** Tracks and manages the capacity of the array.
- **Insertion and Erasure:** Includes functions for inserting and erasing elements at specified positions.
- **Clear:** Clears all elements from the vector.
- **At:** Accesses elements at a specified position with bounds checking.
- **Front and Back:** Retrieves the first and last elements of the vector.
- **Shrink to Fit:** Reduces the capacity of the vector to fit its size.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/knothing01/Vector.git
